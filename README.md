# QUASAR Stochastic Optimizer

[QUASAR](http://www.quantego.com) is a state-of-the-art analytics software that empowers decision-makers to optimize models with random parameters.

Model, optimize, and analyze your decisions directly in iPython. Our trial includes many examples as well as a fully functional version of QUASAR. Only the problem size is limited to lattices with a maximum of 50 nodes per stage and 24 stages.

## Getting started

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation) or [Kitematic](http://www.kitematic.com) on Mac OSX.
- Run `docker run -p 8888:8888 quantego/quasar` or search Kitematic for `quantego/quasar`
- Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
